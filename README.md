## Overview
### The Titanic dataset is a famous dataset that contains information about the passengers onboard the RMS Titanic, which famously sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912. The dataset is often used in data analysis and machine learning projects as a beginner's dataset to practice data exploration, data cleaning, and predictive modeling.
## Context
### The dataset provides various attributes for each passenger, such as their age, sex, ticket class, cabin, fare, and whether they survived or not. The main goal is usually to predict whether a passenger survived based on the given features.

### Content
The dataset consists of the following columns:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's gender (male or female)
Age: Passenger's age in years
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
